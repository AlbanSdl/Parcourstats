# Parcourstats #
Parcourstats is a small software were you can store your [Parcoursup](https://parcoursup.fr/) ranks. It generates graphs and data that should help you to understand how data evolve (and if your wishes may be fulfilled). Displayed data does not provide a complete overview and won't predict the future (nor yours) !

If you feel like a feature, a graph, a stat is missing, let us now by [opening an issue](https://github.com/AlbanSdl/Parcourstats/issues/new).
